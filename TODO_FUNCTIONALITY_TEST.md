# Todo Functionality Test & Debug Guide

## What I Fixed

### 1. SharedSidebar Todo Count Logic
- **Issue**: Teachers weren't seeing pending work count in sidebar
- **Fix**: Enhanced logic to properly calculate pending reviews from `teacherAssignments` data
- **Method**: Now checks `assignment.submissions` array for items with `status: 'submitted'` and no `gradedAt` field

### 2. Data Flow Improvement
```javascript
// For Teachers:
TeacherLayout → fetchTeacherAssignments() → Redux Store → SharedSidebar → Calculate pending reviews

// Backend Structure:
Assignment {
  submissions: [
    {
      status: 'submitted',
      gradedAt: null,  // This means pending review
      // ... other fields
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Added Real-time Updates
- Stats refresh every 30 seconds
- Enhanced debugging with detailed console logs
- Synchronized data between TeacherTodo and SharedSidebar

## How to Test

### For Teachers:
1. **Create an Assignment**
   - Go to a class and create a new assignment
   - Set a due date in the future

2. **Have Students Submit**
   - Students need to submit work for the assignment
   - Submissions should have `status: 'submitted'`

3. **Check Todo Count**
   - Should appear as a red badge on "To-do Work" in sidebar
   - Number should match ungraded submissions

4. **Grade Submissions**
   - Go to the assignment and grade some submissions
   - Todo count should decrease accordingly

### Debug Console Logs
Look for these logs in browser console:
```
TeacherAssignments in sidebar: [...]
Assignment [title]: X pending submissions
Total pending reviews calculated: X
Stats data in sidebar: {...}
Pending work count: X
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Todo count shows 0 but there are submissions
**Check**: 
- Are submissions status = 'submitted'?
- Is gradedAt field null?
- Are teacherAssignments loaded in Redux?

### Issue 2: Count doesn't update after grading
**Solution**: 
- Refresh will update (30-second auto-refresh)
- Or manually navigate away and back

### Issue 3: Mismatch between sidebar and todo page
**Cause**: Different calculation methods
**Solution**: Both now use same logic - fixed!

## Backend Verification

Check these endpoints:
1. `GET /teacher/stats` - Should return `assignments` count
2. `GET /assignment/teacher-assignments` - Should return assignments with submissions array

## Files Modified

1. `SharedSidebar.jsx` - Enhanced todo calculation
2. `TeacherTodo.jsx` - Improved error handling and logging
3. `StudentTodo.jsx` - Enhanced navigation and error handling

The todo functionality should now properly show pending work for teachers based on ungraded submissions!

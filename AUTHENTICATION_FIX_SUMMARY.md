# Todo Functionality - Authentication Fix

## âœ… **Root Cause Identified:**

The todo pages were blank because of **authentication mismatch**:
- **Backend**: Uses cookie-based authentication (`req.cookies.teacherToken`)
- **Frontend**: Was trying to use Bearer token authentication
- **Result**: API calls were failing with "Failed to fetch assignments"

## âœ… **Fixes Applied:**

### 1. **Fixed Assignment Actions (Redux)**
- Removed `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` headers
- Now uses `withCredentials: true` with cookies only
- Fixed both `fetchTeacherAssignments` and `fetchAssignments`
- Added proper error logging

### 2. **Fixed API Endpoints**
- Teacher assignments: `http://localhost:8080/assignment/teacher-assignments`
- Student assignments: `http://localhost:8080/assignment/student-assignments`
- Stats endpoints: `http://localhost:8080/teacher/stats` & `http://localhost:8080/student/stats`

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added retry buttons in both todo components
- Better error messages showing specific failure reasons
- Improved debugging with response status codes

### 4. **Improved Authentication**
- All API calls now use `credentials: 'include'` for cookie authentication
- Added proper headers: `'Content-Type': 'application/json'`
- Enhanced logging to track authentication status

## ðŸš€ **Testing Instructions:**

### **Step 1: Clear Browser Data**
```
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Clear cookies and local storage
4. Refresh the page
```

### **Step 2: Login Again**
```
1. Login as a teacher
2. Check console for authentication success
3. Navigate to todo page (/teacher/todos)
```

### **Step 3: Check Console Logs**
Look for these messages:
```
âœ… "Fetching teacher assignments..."
âœ… "Stats response status for Teacher: 200"
âœ… "Received assignments data: {...}"
âœ… "Stats data in sidebar: {...}"
```

### **Step 4: If Still Getting Errors**
1. **Check Backend Server**: Ensure it's running on port 8080
2. **Check Authentication**: Verify teacher login cookies exist
3. **Check Database**: Ensure teacher has assignments with submissions
4. **Use Retry Button**: Click "Retry Loading" if errors persist

## ðŸ”§ **Backend Requirements:**

For todo functionality to work, ensure:
1. **Server Running**: Backend on `http://localhost:8080`
2. **Authentication Working**: Cookie-based auth is functional
3. **Test Data Exists**:
   - Teacher has created assignments
   - Students have submitted work
   - Some submissions are ungraded (gradedAt = null)

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Results:**

**Sidebar:**
- Red badge showing pending work count
- Count updates automatically every 30 seconds

**Todo Page:**
- Shows pending reviews for teachers
- Shows upcoming deadlines
- Displays assignment details with submission counts
- Links to assignment pages for grading

**Debug Panel:**
- Loading: false
- Error: none  
- Teacher Assignments: [positive number]
- Pending Reviews: [positive number]

The authentication fix should resolve the "Failed to fetch assignments" error and make the todo pages functional! ðŸŽ¯
